  <h2 id="leader-title1">William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham</h2>
  <p>William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, PC, FRS (15 November 1708 – 11 May 1778) was a British statesman of the Whig
    group who served as Prime Minister of Great Britain in the middle of the 18th century. Historians call him Pitt of
    Chatham, or William Pitt the Elder, to distinguish him from his son, William Pitt the Younger, who also was a prime
    minister. Pitt was also known as the Great Commoner, because of his long-standing refusal to accept a title until
    1766. Pitt is best known as the wartime political leader of Britain in the Seven Years' War, especially for his
    single-minded devotion to victory over France, a victory which ultimately solidified Britain's dominance over world
    affairs. He is also known for his popular appeal, his opposition to corruption in government, his support for the
    American position in the run-up to the American Revolutionary War, his advocacy of British greatness, expansionism
    and empire, and his antagonism towards Britain's chief enemies and rivals for colonial power, Spain and France.
    Marie Peters argues his statesmanship was based on a clear, consistent, and distinct appreciation of the value of
    the Empire.</p>

  <h2 id="leader-title2">Major-General Robert Clive</h2>
  <p>Major-General Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive KB, FRS (29 September 1725 – 22 November 1774), also known as Clive of India,[1][2][3] was the first British Governor of the Bengal Presidency. He is credited along with Warren Hastings for laying the foundation of British rule in India.[4][5] He began as a writer (the term used then in India for an office clerk) for the East India Company (EIC) who established the military and political supremacy of the EIC on the Indian subcontinent by winning the Battle of Plassey.[6] In return for supporting the Nawab of Bengal Mir Jafar on the throne, Clive was granted a jaghire of £30,000 (equivalent to £4,100,000 in 2019) per year which was the rent the EIC would otherwise pay to the Nawab for their tax farming concession. When he left India he had a fortune of £180,000 (equivalent to £24,300,000 in 2019) which he remitted through the Dutch East India Company.[7]</p>
